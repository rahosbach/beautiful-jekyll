My name is Robert Hosbach and I am a self-proclaimed data junkie. I am an environmental engineer by education, and it was in completing my [Master's thesis](http://humboldt-dspace.calstate.edu/handle/2148/904) in [Environmental Resources Engineering from Humboldt State University](http://engineering.humboldt.edu/) that I first learned to properly question and analyze real-world data.  For that I owe a debt of gratitude to my thesis advisor, Dr. Charles Chamberlin.  

After earning my M.S., I have been blessed with the opportunity to work on interesting projects that have not only honed my data analysis skillset, but also afforded me the opportunity to learn and practice with various tools necessary for analyzing and visualizing data.

#### Some of the main "tools" I currently use are:
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) ([tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), among others)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), among others)
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
- SQL (as well as database design)
