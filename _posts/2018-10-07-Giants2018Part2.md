In June I authored [a post](https://rahosbach.github.io/2018-06-30-Giants2018/) that used pitching data to peer into how well the Giants had started the 2018 season compared to previous years.  At that point, the Giants had just wrapped up their 83rd game of the season.  Now that the season is over (by way of a [15-0 drubbing by the Dodgers](https://www.google.com/search?q=sfgiants&rlz=1C1JZAP_enUS721US721&oq=sfgiants&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3j69i60j0.955j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11f541w79d;4;/m/09p14;dt;fp;1), of all teams), it's time to take a look at how the Giants performed during their last 79 games of 2018.

All of the data and methodology I used in the June post has been replicated here, so please see that post for details.

### Results
In each of the following plots, a line chart is provided for each season from 2010-2018, and each season has been labeled with an indicator of playoff success:
- WSC: World Series Champions (2010, 2012, and 2014)
- NLDS: Lost in National League Division Series (2016)
- DNP: Did not make playoffs (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2018)

For me, each plot has a key takeaway:
- Since 2010, this season marked SF's 2nd lowest wins total (89, or a 55% win percentage).  Only in 2017 were we worse, and it comes as no surprise that we did not make the playoffs in either year.
- This year we racked up nearly a -100 run differential.  Again, only in 2017 did we fare worse.  It's worth noting the "cliff" we jumped off during those last 10-12 games of the season, where our run differential took a nosedive.  We did not end the season with our heads held high.
- SF's cumulative ERA by the end of the season was on par with 2013 (another no-playoffs season), but about half a point lower than in 2017.  If there is anything we can be proud of this year, it's that our starting pitchers (including some young guns) really showed their merit.
- Our total number of saves this season was also on par with 2013 and noticeably higher than 2017.  It did seem like our relief and closing pitchers did better this year than in 2017, and this plot would support that.
- However, this year we also had nine blown saves resulting in loss, second only to 2017.  It's worth remembering that a key reason we had so many save opportunities this year is that there were many close games, due to our lack of run generation.  Again, if I was upset with anything this season, it was our hitting (a perennial problem it seems), not our pitching.

### Conclusion
It's no surprise: The Giants bombed out of 2018 in horrible fashion.  We do have some hope going forward with respect to our pitching staff, but we really need to figure out how to generate some run support.  The odds seem to favor the Giants acquiring Bryce Harper from the Nationals, which could provide a much-needed left-hand power hitter.  We'll see.

And, much to my dismay, my mid-season projection of the Giants winning the NL West for the first time since 2012 was miserably wrong.  I could lament about injuries and trades and a plethora of other things; but, the fact is, the Giants are not in the 2018 playoffs.  It's time to enjoy what we can of the playoffs, then look ahead to 2019.
