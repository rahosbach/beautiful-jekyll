title: Are Women Waiting Longer to have Children in the U.S.?

Living in the Bay Area for the past number of years opened my eyes to this concept of women waiting longer to have children. The prevailing reasoning tends to be something along the lines of millenials wanting to achieve more career-wise early on have a more solid foundation (economically) before starting a family.  In fact, a [2016 New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/science/age-when-american-women-have-children.html) cites a sociologist as saying that one possible reason for women waiting to have children could have been the recession.  Other reasons may include better contraception and better medical care for mothers giving birth at higher ages.

In this post we'll take a look at some data to see if women are actually waiting longer to have children, and, if so, whether or not there are any differences we can see based on which state the births occur.

### Data
The main data source for this post is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) natality public use data for 1995-2016, which can be accessed using the [WONDER Online Database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality.html).  This dataset contains information on birth location (down to the county level), characteristics of the mother (_e.g._, age, marital status, and education level), characteristics of the birth (_e.g._, weight of the baby and delivery method), as well as information on maternal risk factors (_e.g._, diabetes and eclampsia).  For this post, we are only concerned with the birth location (at the state level) as well as the mother's age at the birth.  It is worth noting that while the 2007-2016 data contain the mother's age down to a single year for all births, the data from 1995-2006 use bins to characterize the mother's age at birth: less than 15 years, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, and 50 years or older.  Therefore, for consistency, in this analysis we will use these mother age bins for _all_ years from 1995-2016.

In addition to the CDC's natality data, I also used information from the U.S. Census Bureau regarding the [land area](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/state-area.html) and [2016 population](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/popest/state-total.html) (projected from the 2010 census) for each U.S. state (plus Washington, D.C.).  I am curious to see if a state's population density (average number of people per square mile of land area) correlates at all with the state's average age of mothers at birth.

### Results
To read in the data, analyze the data, and create visualizations for this post I used the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) library in R.

As a first step, I wanted to see how the average age of mothers at birth had changed over time for the entire U.S.  To do this, I calculated a weighted-average birth age for each year, which is equal to the sum of the year's total births multiplied by the average age in the age bin (_e.g._, 17 in the 15-19 age bin), and then that sum divided by the sum of the year's total births.  This approach assumes a uniform distribution of births across all the ages in the age bin, which is not strictly true; however, for obtaining a general look into how the average age may be changing over time, this approach is fine.  For this part of the analysis I ignored the age bins of less than 15 years old and 50 years or older.  This is because few births occur in those age bins, and it is difficult to assign an average age to those bins.

As you can see from the plot above, it would appear that the national weighted-average mother age at birth has been rising since 1995.  In fact, from 2009-2016 there has been a rapid increase of about 0.5 years in the average mother age at birth for every three calendar years.  Interesting.

But since we have the data, let's now take a look at how the weighted-average mother age at birth has been changing since 1995 for each State.  Using the same assumptions as for the national plot above, the State-level results are provided below.  Note that the States are sorted in descending order by population density (persons per square mile).  As you can see, there is a not a single state in the U.S. for which the weighted-average mother age at birth has gone down since 1995.  For many states the average age was rising into the early 2000s, then it remained relatively steady through the mid-2000s, and began increasing again around 2009.

Now, one simple way we could determine if state population density correlates with the weighted-average age at birth is to compare the population density with the 2016 weighted-average birth age for 2016.  I would expect to see a higher weighted-average birth age for states that have more big cities and are generally more urban (_i.e._, having higher population densities).  The scatterplot below contains a data point for each of the States (except Washington, D.C., which has an extremely high population density of greater than 11,000 persons per square mile), along with a best-fit linear regression.  As you can see, while the data do not fall perfectly on this regression line, it does appear that a positive correlation exists between population density and weighted-average mother age at birth (for 2016).

### Conclusions
Well, based on this analysis it is plain to see that **the average age of mothers at birth has been rising over the 1995-2016 time period on a national as well as for each State.**  In fact, from 2009-2015 the national average age of mothers at birth increased a full year, and the trend appears to continue through 2016.  Additionally, my suspicion of higher mother age at birth in more urban areas appears to have some merit (though other factors are obviously still at play that have not been analyzed here).
